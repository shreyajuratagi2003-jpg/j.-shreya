    "# Expense Tracker System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The Expense Tracker System is a menu-driven Python mini project designed to help users record, manage, and monitor daily expenses efficiently. The system allows users to add, view, search, and delete expense records while storing data permanently using file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Tracking expenses manually can lead to incorrect calculations, loss of data, and difficulty in monitoring spending habits. This project provides a simple digital solution for effective expense management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Add new expense records\n",
    "- View all expenses\n",
    "- Search expenses by category\n",
    "- Delete expense records\n",
    "- Menu-driven user interface\n",
    "- Permanent data storage using file handling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Fields Used\n",
    "- Expense ID\n",
    "- Date\n",
    "- Category\n",
    "- Description\n",
    "- Amount\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Structures\n",
    "- Dictionary of Lists\n",
    "- Lists for storing multiple expense records\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Structures\n",
    "- while loop\n",
    "- if / elif / else statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Used\n",
    "- view_expenses()\n",
    "- add_expense()\n",
    "- search_expense()\n",
    "- delete_expense()\n",
    "- save_to_file()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used\n",
    "- List methods: append(), pop(), len()\n",
    "- Dictionary methods: keys(), values(), get()\n",
    "- String methods: strip(), title()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Handling\n",
    "- try / except blocks are used to handle invalid inputs such as entering text instead of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Handling\n",
    "- Expense data is saved in a text file named expenses.txt\n",
    "- with open() is used for reading and writing data safely\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "1. Open Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "2. Open Expense_Tracker_System.ipynb\n",
    "3. Run all cells\n",
    "4. Follow the menu displayed on the screen\n",
